		* Left pane, "2", is local, right pane is remote, "3". For rebase though, left seems to be master and right the local branch.

		* When a file is good, use `:Gw` and move on
		* When finished you get to the end of the quickfix list, use `:G` to check status then `cc` to commit.
		* After commit, use `rr` in the status screen or `:G rebase --contine` and hope you don't get a fresh set of conflicts, but if you do, repeat from the top.
